Our application leverages advanced artificial intelligence models to assist in the early detection of cancer. By analyzing medical imaging with high precision, the system identifies potential tumor regions and highlights areas of concern for clinicians. The goal is not to replace medical expertise but to provide a powerful decision-support tool that improves diagnostic accuracy, speeds up analysis, and supports earlier intervention.
